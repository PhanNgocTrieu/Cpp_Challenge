	//Caring for a plant can be hard work, but since you tend to it regularly, you have a plant that grows consistently.Each day, its height increases by a fixed amount represented by the integer upSpeed.But due to lack of sunlight, the plant decreases in height every night, by an amount represented by downSpeed.

	//Since you grew the plant from a seed, it started at height 0 initially.Given an integer desiredHeight, your task is to find how many days it'll take for the plant to reach this height.

	//Example

	//For upSpeed = 100, downSpeed = 10, and desiredHeight = 910, the output should be
	//growingPlant(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight) = 10.

	//#		Day	Night
	//1		100	90
	//2		190	180
	//3		280	270
	//4		370	360
	//5		460	450
	//6		550	540
	//7		640	630
	//8		730	720
	//9		820	810
	//10	910	900
	//The plant first reaches a height of 910 on day 10.
