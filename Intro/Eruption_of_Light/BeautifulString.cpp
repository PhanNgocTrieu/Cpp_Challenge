//A string is said to be beautiful 
//if each letter in the string appears at most as many times as the previous letter in the alphabet within the string; 
//ie: b occurs no more times than a; c occurs no more times than b; etc.
//
//Given a string, check whether it is beautiful.
//
//Example
//
//For inputString = "bbbaacdafe", the output should be isBeautifulString(inputString) = true.
//
//This string contains 3 as, 3 bs, 1 c, 1 d, 1 e, and 1 f(and 0 of every other letter), 
//so since there aren't any letters that appear more frequently than the previous letter, this string qualifies as beautiful.
//
//For inputString = "aabbb", the output should be isBeautifulString(inputString) = false.
//
//Since there are more bs than as, this string is not beautiful.
//
//For inputString = "bbc", the output should be isBeautifulString(inputString) = false.
//
//Although there are more bs than cs, this string is not beautiful because there are no as, so therefore there are more bs than as.
